            <p>It doesn't get any bigger than the Lourve. From the iconic building,

                You'll want to spend a significant chunk of time visiting The Lourve

            <p>Across the Seine from the Lourve Museum is another Parisian
                art gem, the Musée d'Orsay. My personal favorite of the European
                art museums, the d'Orsay features the largest collection of Impressionist
                and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world, including works by

            <p>The sumptuous seat of the French monarchy, the Versailles Palace
               is the second most-visited monument in the Île-de-France region (behind the Lourve
               museum and ahead of the Eiffel Tower). I recommend either getting the audioguide or 
               joining a tour so that you make the most of your time in the Palace.

                    Highlights of the palace include:

            <h2>Bonus: Berlin East Side Gallery</h2>
            <h3>Berlin</h3>
            <h4>Admission: free</h4>
            <img src="/Users/christinagomez/lc101/html-me-something/images/east-side-gallery/main_image.jpg" alt="Image from Versailles Museum" height="600px" width="500px">            
            <p>In homage to Berlin's totalitarian history (both under the Third Reich and then 
                subsequently under Communist control), the Berlin East Side Gallery features 
                105 paintings from artists around the world representing peace, unity, free 
                expression, and a better future for people all over the world. At the time of commission, the political and social division between West and East Germany
                was ending and the works represent a time of great euphoria for Berliners.
            </p>
            <p>
                Highlights from the gallery include:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Dimitri Vrubel, My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love</em></li>
